# ChatGPT - Introduction

Welcome to this specialized module of the Holberton School IT curriculum, focused on enhancing code quality and efficiency by integrating artificial intelligence into everyday coding practices.

## Project Overview

This project centers on two key aspects of software development: **debugging** and **automation**. By working through these tasks, you will learn how to leverage ChatGPT to identify and resolve errors more efficiently, as well as automate repetitive coding tasks-boosting both your productivity and the quality of your code.

---

## Objectives

- **Debugging:** Learn how to use ChatGPT to diagnose and fix bugs in code samples across multiple programming languages. This will improve your problem-solving skills and deepen your understanding of common programming pitfalls.
- **Automation:** Discover how to automate routine coding tasks with ChatGPT, including generating boilerplate code, documentation, and basic unit tests. This allows you to focus on more complex and creative aspects of development.

---

## Expected Outcomes

- **Enhanced Debugging Skills:** Gain confidence in troubleshooting and refining code, with the ability to clearly articulate problems and implement AI-driven solutions.
- **Automation Proficiency:** Develop the skills to use AI for automating coding tasks, resulting in more structured and error-free code.

---

## Project Structure

- **debugging/**: Exercises focused on identifying and fixing code errors (Python, HTML/JS, etc.).
- **documentation/**: Exercises for improving code documentation and adding docstrings.
- **error_handling/**: Tasks involving the implementation of robust error handling.
- **automation/**: Exercises on generating code or tests automatically.

---

## Example Tasks

- Fix a Python factorial function that runs infinitely.
- Modify a script to print only command-line arguments, excluding the script name.
- Correct an HTML/JS button so it properly changes the background color.
- Add structured comments to a recursive function.
- Prevent a program from crashing when the user enters invalid input.

---

## Usage Tips

- **Test** your corrections in the terminal after making changes.
- **Read** error messages carefully-they often point directly to the problem.
- **Ask** ChatGPT for explanations about bugs or code you donâ€™t understand.
- **Automate** repetitive tasks to save time and reduce errors.
